# Test Plan for Avalanche Wallet CLI

You need access to a Ledger Nano S, and you should have already installed the
latest version of the Avalanche ledger app from
https://github.com/obsidiansystems/ledger-app-avax.

Get a fresh copy of this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/obsidiansystems/avalanche-wallet-cli.git avalanche-wallet-cli-test --recursive
cd avalanche-wallet-cli-test
git checkout <git commit that you are testing>
```

You should now follow the instructions in the README.md file to install all
dependencies. Following them should get you into a position where you can run
`cli/cli.js --help` and successfully see the help text.

## list-devices

With your ledger unplugged, run `cli/cli.js list-devices`. You should see only
an empty list, `[]`, i.e. no devices are connected.

Now connect your ledger device and enter your pin code so you are in the main
menu, and run `cli/cli.js list-devices` again. Now you should see an item in the
list which looks something like `[ '/dev/hidraw7' ]` (the exact output will
likely be different for you, but there should be one entry).

## get-device-model

With your ledger unplugged, run `cli/cli.js get-device-model`. You should
receive an error saying there is no device. Now connect your ledger and enter
your pin code, and run `cli/cli.js get-device-model` again. This time you should
see output similar to this:

```js
{
  id: 'nanoS',
  productName: 'Ledger Nano S',
  productIdMM: 16,
  legacyUsbProductId: 1,
  usbOnly: true,
  memorySize: 327680,
  blockSize: 4096
}
```

With your ledger still plugged in (and in the main menu), run `cli/cli.js
list-devices` and note down where your device is connected. For example, if you
got `[ '/dev/hidraw7' ]`, your device would be located at `/dev/hidraw7` (ignore
the brackets and apostrophes).

> __Note for macOS__: you'll get a very long result from `list-devices`. It'll look
> like this:
> ```bash
> $ cli/cli.js list-devices
> [
>   'IOService:/AppleACPIPlatformExpert/PCI0@0/AppleACPIPCI/XHC1@14/XHC1@14000000/HS02@14200000/Nano S@14200000/Nano S@0/IOUSBHostHIDDevice@14200000,0'
> ]
> ```
> You should name the result you get so the following steps are easier to do:
> ```bash
> export LEDGER='IOService:/AppleACPIPlatformExpert/PCI0@0/AppleACPIPCI/XHC1@14/XHC1@14000000/HS02@14200000/Nano S@14200000/Nano S@0/IOUSBHostHIDDevice@14200000,0'
> ```
> Then in the following steps, use $LEDGER as your device instead of
> /dev/hidraw7.

Run `cli/cli.js get-device-model --device /dev/hidraw7` (but replace /dev/hidraw7
with the path you got from list-devices). You should get the same output as
running get-device-model with no --device option.

Run `cli/cli.js get-device-model --device abc`. You should get an error saying
"cannot open device with path abc".

## get-wallet-id

With your ledger plugged in and unlocked, navigate to the Avax app and open it.
Once it's open, run `cli/cli.js get-wallet-id`. You should get back a short
series of letters and numbers, e.g. `4f4c48e1aa77` If you run the command
multiple times with a particular device, you should get the same result.

## get-new-receive-address

Navigate to the web wallet https://wallet.avax.network/. If you've used this
before with your ledger (and the mnemonic phrase hasn't changed), you can
activate your wallet by typing in the password you set previously. Otherwise,
click "Access", then "Mnemonic Key Phrase". Enter the key phrase you used to set
up your ledger device. You should then see your wallet with the balance and an
address with the label

> This is your address to receive funds.

We'll now check that the CLI shows the same address as the web wallet.

With your ledger in the Avax app, run `cli/cli.js get-new-receive-address`.
You'll be prompted to accept the command on your ledger. The ledger text should
be "Provide Extended Public Key", "Derivation Path 44'/9000'/0'", and then an
address beginning with "X-" (note this address will not be the same as the web
wallet or the address shown by the CLI itself). Upon accepting this, the CLI
should return the same address as the web wallet.

Now use the faucet (https://faucet.avax.network/) to send some tokens to the
address that is displayed. Refresh your web wallet and see that the receive
address has changed.  Run `cli/cli.js get-new-receive-address` again, and check
it matches the new web wallet address.

## get-balance

Like the previous section, we'll use the web wallet and check the total balance
displayed matches the returned value by the CLI.

Run `cli/cli.js get-balance`. You will be prompted to accept the command on your
ledger. The ledger text should be "Provide Extended Public Key", "Derivation
Path 44'/9000'/0'", and then an address beginning with "X-". Upon accepting
this, the CLI should return your total balance, and this should match the web
wallet. You can get more testnet funds by following the instructions in the
get-new-receive-address section.

This function can also be used to check the balance of a particular address.

This is done by running `cli/cli.js get-balance X-address` where `X-address`
sholud be replaced by an address you've funded via the faucet. Provided you
haven't transferred, the balance of that individual address should be
1,000,000,000 nAVAX (the current value the faucet provides).

## transfer

Run

```bash
export NEW_ADDRESS=$(cli/cli.js get-new-receive-address)
echo $NEW_ADDRESS
cli/cli.js transfer --to $NEW_ADDRESS --amount 10000000
```

You'll be prompted to accept a "Provide Extended Public Key" request on your
ledger. Accept this, then, a couple of seconds later, you should be presented
with the destination address and the amount being transferred.  Check that it the
destination address and amount is what you expect. (The destination address
should match the result of `echo $NEW_ADDRESS`).

You should then also be presented with the fees associated with the transaction.

Finally, if everything looks right, go ahead and accept the transaction. The
CLI should print something that looks like this:
```
Issuing TX...
iFXtVUYyH1jkcptfuJ1DkHhNG3BVW2zYygexXLGFytbCMz6kE
```
Where the last long line is your transaction hash (yours will differ). Go to
https://explorer.avax.network/tx/iFXtVUYyH1jkcptfuJ1DkHhNG3BVW2zYygexXLGFytbCMz6kE
(substitute your hash!) and check that 0.01 AVAX was sent to the address
`$NEW_ADDRESS` (this is shown in the output section).

Note that the value may be much larger than 100, but the difference should be
sent to another of your addresses (it'll be the output address which isn't
`$NEW_ADDRESS`). You can run `cli/cli.js get-balance
--list-addresses` to check that this address did indeed get the leftover funds.

Finally, one should replay these tests and attempt to reject the transaction at
every prompt.

## get-address

Run `cli/cli.js get-address 0/0`. You'll be prompted on your ledger device, and
it should return the address in the terminal. You should check that the address
shown on your ledger device matches the address returned in the terminal.

Also, this should match the web wallet. To check this, in the web wallet, go to
the "Manage" page in the left menu. The bottom section, "My Keys", should list
your active keys (probably only one). Within that key are a section of buttons
on the right hand side: two icons and a "View Key Phrase" button. First you must
be sure that the web wallet is using the same mnemonic phrase as your ledger
device. Click the "View Key Phrase" button and verify they match. If they don't
you must reset the web wallet and create another with the same phrase, and go
through these instructions again. If they do match, hover over the icon buttons
next to "View Key Phrase" and click the one which is labeled "HD Addresses".
You should see a list of all the addresses you've had in the past in this
wallet, ordered by the index (`#` column). If you have many addresses here, you
can check they match by running `cli/cli.js get-address 0/N` where you
substitute the number in the `#` column as `N`. So, for the third key in the
list, you'd run `cli/cli.js get-address 0/2`. You don't need to check them all,
just pick a few.

## get-extended-public-key

Run `cli/cli.js get-extended-public-key 0/0`. You should be prompted on your ledger
device to "Provide Extended Public Key". The path displayed on your ledger
should match the path printed in the terminal. The extended public key returned should look something like:

```
xpub661MyMwAqRbcFH27nCDjzK2FZdQPs9r4PhxYwANH7CkLqA66YiY2ji4RJVcvg4QQoMRLMyRG8Y3y5c7cCu5fkU1wdUA7pmSZQrJ5rwsQAW1
```

## get-app-details

Run `cli/cli.js get-app-details`. This should immediately return with the ledger
app version and git commit. The git commit should match the version you
installed.

# Atomic swaps

For any of the following sections, you should also test rejecting the ledger
prompts at any stage of the `import` or `export` commands, and verify that you
can repeat the command afterwards.

## export (X-Chain to P-Chain)

First you should check you have enough funds by running:
```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance
```

You should have at least 10,000,000 nAVAX. Also note this value down,
we'll be checking it later.

```bash
export P_CHAIN_ADDRESS=$(cli/cli.js get-new-receive-address --chain P)
echo $P_CHAIN_ADDRESS
cli/cli.js export --to $P_CHAIN_ADDRESS --amount 5000000
```

Your ledger will prompt you to `Provide Extended Public Key` for `Derivation
Path 44'/9000'/0'`. You should accept this prompt. A few seconds later, it
should prompt you with `Sign Export`. Select `Next`, and you should be prompted
with the change address and amount. Accept this screen, and you should be
prompted with `X to P chain`, with the amount, which should be 5000000, and the
address which should be the same as `$P_CHAIN_ADDRESS`. Verify that it is, and
select `Next`. The following prompt will be the transaction fee. Accept the
remainder of the prompts. This should drop the balance on your X-Chain address,
run:

```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance
```

and verify that this value has dropped by 5,000,000 nAVAX (transfer amount) and the
transaction fee (whatever the ledger shows, currently 1,000,000 nAVAX).

## import (X-Chain to P-Chain)

Continuing on from the previous section, run

```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance --chain P
```

to check the current balance of your P-Chain addresses. Import the funds from
the X-Chain:

```bash
cli/cli.js import --to $P_CHAIN_ADDRESS
```

This will prompt to `Provide Extended Public Key`. Accept this, and the ledger
will prompt you to `Sign Import`. Scroll to `Next` and continue, the screen
should change to `From X chain` along with the amount you're importing (minus
the transaction fee, which is shown on the next step). Verify that the
transaction fee and amount shown by the ledger add up to equal the amount you
exported in the previous step. Accept the remaining prompts, and check the
balance of your P-Chain address `$P_CHAIN_ADDRESS` has increased:

```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance --chain P
```

This should return your previous balance, plus 5,000,000 nAVAX, minus the transaction
fee (currently 1,000,000 nAVAX). You should also check the `$P_CHAIN_ADDRESS` balance
directly:

```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance $P_CHAIN_ADDRESS
```

This should be 5,000,000 nAVAX, minus the transaction fee.

## export (P-Chain to X-Chain)

Now we have funds on the P-Chain, we can test swapping them back to the X-Chain.
Check your current P-Chain balance:

```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance --chain P
```

Now export the funds to a new X-Chain address:

```bash
export X_CHAIN_ADDRESS=$(cli/cli.js get-new-receive-address --chain X)
echo $X_CHAIN_ADDRESS
cli/cli.js export --to $X_CHAIN_ADDRESS --amount 3000000
```

You'll be prompted to `Provide Extended Public Key`, which you should accept.
The ledger will then prompt you to `Sign Hash`, along with the danger warnings.
Check that the hash matches the one printed by the CLI (after `Signing
transaction`). If they match, accept the transaction, and check that your
P-Chain balance has decreased:

```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance --chain P
```

It should have decreased by 3,000,000 nAVAX (the transfer amount) and
also decreased by an additional amount equal to the transaction fee,
which is currently 1,000,000 nAVAX.

## import (P-Chain to X-Chain)

Check the balance of your X-Chain addresses, and make a note of the amount:

```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance --chain X
```

Import the funds from the P-Chain:

```bash
cli/cli.js import --to $X_CHAIN_ADDRESS
```

Again, you'll be prompted to `Provide Extended Public Key`. Accept this prompt,
and the following prompt should be `Sign Import`. Scroll to `Next` and continue,
the screen should change to `From P chain` along with the amount you're
importing (minus the transaction fee, which is shown in the next step). Verify
that the transaction fee and the amount shown by the ledger add up to equal the
amount you exported in the previous step (3,000,000 nAVAX). Accept the remaining
prompts, and check the balance of your X-Chain addresses has increased:

```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance --chain X
```

This should have increased by 3,000,000 nAVAX, minus the transaction fee (i.e. it
should increase by the amount the ledger displayed). You should also check the
`$X_CHAIN_ADDRESS` balance directly:

```bash
cli/cli.js get-balance $X_CHAIN_ADDRESS
```

This should be 3,000,000 nAVAX, minus the transaction fee.
